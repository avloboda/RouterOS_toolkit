# RouterOS Toolkit

Requires Python3.6+

Scripts require the librouteros 2.2.0+ library, which can be found here: https://github.com/luqasz/librouteros

Most scripts will require a devices_list file, which needs to contain the IP or hostname of the devices to be configured. There should be only one IP or hostname per line.
The included devices_list file is an example of how the file should look.
